Common Lisp in Prolog 
=================

This library is designed to *not* be just another an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.

## Useful to Me?  [CONTRIBUTING.md]

* Translates Lisp source files into Prolog source files.  ( compilation is done by Host prolog on the Translated source (from either disk or memory)) 

* At the REPL, forms are converted from Lisp to Prolog then call/1d 

* Being written as a SWI-Prolog "pack" 

* Picks up freebies .. whatever the host prolog system offers such as 
**Makes Plaform Executables and. DLL/So files 
**Garbage Collection 
**Memoization 
**Embedding (from C/C++/Python/C#/Mono/Java)  

* Gives MOP/CLOS to Prolog programmers 
 
* Goal is to ensure can run in YAP (which Lisp to Prolog benchmarking shows about 4x speedup over SWI)
Very importantly we need to ensure we can run well in
** Sicstus
** PrologCafe
** Yield-Prolog
** Jekejeke
** EcLiPSe Prolog
 
* Most simple functions optimize to how handwritten code might look.. *only* 2-3 slower than compiled SBCL

## Goals and TODOs
* Document this pack!
* Write tests
* Untangle the 'pack' install deps
* Still in progress (Moving predicates over here from logicmoo_base)
* Keep later `copy_term/2's` cheap, 
* Experment with way to passes entire term object object references as atoms  (nb_current/2 allows access to the object's property map)
* Ensure passes most all CL-ANSI tests 
** Hardest part is making sure it throws/complains about all the things it needs to
* Using SWICLI as FFI (SWICLI itself still needs work) 
* Ensure works with ASDF-INSTALL
* Quicklisp

## WHY ?!?!?!
==============


### Myth busting


* Is it really super easy to implement _anything_ on Prolog?  Some junior Prolog programmers would be surprised by Prolog doing any OO let alone MOP.  After all, Prolog is very very simple when it comes to its types. 

* If it can be done, in the end, will it look as ugly as trying to implement and maintain a CommonLisp in a programing language like LOGO?  Everyone who graduates with a CS degree was tasked with several disarming hour just trying to do something as simple as adding up a list of numbers in Prolog. In moments of horror they think how simple it would have been it has it been any other language than Prolog.  Most come away with the misunderstanding that Prolog is only capable of certain pure tasks. And too awkward for everything else.  Much like how LOGO is the best language for mornings you've woken desperately needing to draw a box inside a circle.  Not so much for those mornings, you need to implement an HTTP client. 

* Other myths "prolog doesn't scale".. least will be busted that whenever a lisp program (that scales according to whatever "scale" means) is running on a lisp-in-prolog (like WAM-CL) 

* Some people say it's absolutely absurd to try to implement common Lisp inside a Prolog because of the final result would be to inefficient run to slow use it too much memory etc .

### Practical reasons: 

* Several decades of Common Lisp development libraries can, within a matter of hours, be translated to useable Prolog development libraries. 

* Also, DAYDREAMER, Knowledge Machine, SWALE, and CYC might perform differently and be more practical at non-toy domains. 


## FUTHER MISTHOUGHT:

I'll reply inline and correct some of the confusing misstatements I had made.

> >

prolog-in-lisp(s) are *not* 1000x slower than prolog-in-c but certainly not as fast (I apologize, I should have said 5-10x time slower).  The problem arises for Prolog programs like: English to CommonLogic converters (used in Natural Language Understanding), large-scale ontology checkers, KL-ONE language interpreters, and PDDL planners (Planning Domain Definition Language).  Such programs perform fine when written entirely in Lisp or Prolog (neither better or worse).  The problem is that they more often perform unacceptably poor when written in Prolog and then ran on a prolog-in-lisp interpreter.    

This leads to another class of programs 

> > and be at least in the top 3 impls
> >         for speed Â…   Also the type of lisp programs I like to run (SWALE, DAYDREAMER) are buggy partial impl of Greenspun's rule as applied to Prolog (Instead of Lisp)

I should clarify, SWALE and DAYDREAMER are *not* buggy implementations of Prolog! they are their own things.  But there are certain routines they contain that make extensive use of unification and backtracking.  The routines these programs use are examples where the domain had to be scaled back.  Only because they are under the penalties of the "prolog-in-lisp" scenario.  This scenario is similar to taking an assembly language program that twiddles bitmasks and using bignum math to emulate the registers of the  Intel-4930k CPU. You might just see some performance differences? Very lucky if it was only a 4x-10x slowdown

## Usaage output of --help)
````
WAM-CL (https://github.com/TeamSPoon/wam_common_lisp) is an ANSI Common Lisp implementation.

Usage:  $wamcl [prolog-options] [wamcl-options] [lispfile [argument ...]]

Host Prolog options:

-x state         Start from Image state (must be first)
                 (may be used to debug saved lisp EXEs)

-[LGT]size[KMG]  Specify {Local,Global,Trail} limits
[+/-]tty         Allow tty control
-O               Optimised compilation
--nosignals      Do not modify any signal handling
--nodebug        Omit generation of debug info
--version        Print the Prolog version information

WAM-CL Options:

 -?, --help    - print this help and exit

Lisp Startup actions:
 --ansi        - more ANSI CL compliance  (TODO)
 -p package    - start in the package
 -norc         - do not load the user ~/.wamclrc file   (TODO)
 -lp dir       - add dir to *LOAD-PATHS* (can be repeated)    (TODO)
 -i file       - load initfile (can be repeated)

Compiler actions put WAM-CL into a batch mode:
 -x expressions - execute the expressions (mixed into compiler actions)
 -c [-l] lispfile [-o outputfile] - compile or load a lispfile
               [--exe outputfile] - make a platform binary

Which are overridden by:

  --repl                Enter the interactive read-eval-print loop when done
  --load <filename>     File to load
  --eval <form>         Form to eval

Default action is an interactive read-eval-print loop.

  --quit, -norepl       Exit with status code (instead) from prevous option processing.
                        Otherwise, an interactive read-eval-print loop is entered.

   "lispfile"           When "lispfile" is given, it is loaded (via --load)

Remaining arguments are placed in EXT:*ARGS* as strings.


Examples:

$PACKDIR/wam_common_lisp/prolog/wam_cl$

# creating your first image
$ swipl ../wamcl.pl --exe wamcl
# try it
$ ./wamcl
$ ./wamcl -c hello.lisp -o hello.pl --exe hello
$ ./hello world
$ swipl -x hello --repl
$ swipl hello.pl
$ swipl -x wamcl.prc
% swipl -x wamcl.prc hello.lisp world
